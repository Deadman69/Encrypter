# Encrypter
A basic C# files / folders encrypter

This project allow you to encrypt and decrypt files or folders with just a password (maybe in the future I will add others way such as RSA keys).

You can choose a folder or a single file to encrypt (same for decrypt operations) and then choose a password and there you go !
You can now encrypt or decrypt a file or a folder (and all it's sub-folders)
